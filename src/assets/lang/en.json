    "Yesterday, I rented a car with @getride.id, it was really good to get a Zenix that was only 1000 km so I could try the car too. I think all of their cars are brand new. For those who want to try car rental in Bali, you can go to them!",
    "Rent a car with @getride.id when I went to Bali. Got a Zenix Hybrid car that was only 1000 km and it was really good. The car is really worth it, it's crazy! The car is still new. If you go to Bali, you must rent here.",
    "We rented a hybrid innova zenix car at @getride.id. Taking turns driving was good and no problem. Because there is a sunroof so if a selfie is super good. I didn't expect it to feel so good and feel more efficient and super recommended!",
    "After renting zenyx hybrid at @getride.id Super luxurious. The trunk is very spacious and there are 2 rear monitors. So it feels like I really want to have this. Thank you Get&Ride!",
    "Yesterday in Bali, we used Zenix Hybrid car which was much more economical and more relaxing. We rented it from @getride.id, the car is very complete, super clean and comfortable. Thank you very much! Super nice service delivered to the airport. Next time rent a car here again anyway."
